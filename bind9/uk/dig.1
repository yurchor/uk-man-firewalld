\fBdig\fP is a flexible tool for interrogating DNS name servers\&. It performs
DNS lookups and displays the answers that are returned from the name
server(s) that were queried\&. Most DNS administrators use \fBdig\fP to
troubleshoot DNS problems because of its flexibility, ease of use and
clarity of output\&. Other lookup tools tend to have less functionality than
\fBdig\fP\&.
.PP
Although \fBdig\fP is normally used with command\-line arguments, it also has a
batch mode of operation for reading lookup requests from a file\&. A brief
summary of its command\-line arguments and options is printed when the \fB\-h\fP
option is given\&. Unlike earlier versions, the BIND 9 implementation of
\fBdig\fP allows multiple lookups to be issued from the command line\&.
.PP
Unless it is told to query a specific name server, \fBdig\fP will try each of
the servers listed in /etc/resolv\&.conf\&. If no usable server addresses
are found, \fBdig\fP will send the query to the local host\&.
.PP
When no command line arguments or options are given, \fBdig\fP will perform an
NS query for "\&." (the root)\&.
.PP
It is possible to set per\-user defaults for \fBdig\fP via
${HOME}/\&.digrc\&. This file is read and any options in it are applied
before the command line arguments\&. The \fB\-r\fP option disables this feature,
for scripts that need predictable behaviour\&.
.PP
The IN and CH class names overlap with the IN and CH top level domain
names\&. Either use the \fB\-t\fP and \fB\-c\fP options to specify the type and
class, use the \fB\-q\fP the specify the domain name, or use "IN\&." and "CH\&."
when looking up these top level domains\&.
.SH "ПРОСТЕ КОРИСТУВАННЯ"
.PP
A typical invocation of \fBdig\fP looks like:
.sp
 dig @сервер назва тип
.sp
де
.PP
\fBсервер\fP
.RS 4
is the name or IP address of the name server to query\&. This can be an IPv4
address in dotted\-decimal notation or an IPv6 address in colon\-delimited
notation\&. When the supplied \fIserver\fP argument is a hostname, \fBdig\fP
resolves that name before querying that name server\&.
.sp
If no \fIserver\fP argument is provided, \fBdig\fP consults /etc/resolv\&.conf; if
an address is found there, it queries the name server at that address\&. If
either of the \fB\-4\fP or \fB\-6\fP options are in use, then only addresses for the
corresponding transport will be tried\&. If no usable addresses are found,
\fBdig\fP will send the query to the local host\&. The reply from the name
server that responds is displayed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBназва\fP
.RS 4

\fItype\fP can be any valid query type\&. If no \fItype\fP argument is supplied,
\fBdig\fP will perform a lookup for an A record\&.

"::"\&. An optional port may be specified by appending "#<port>"
.RE

Set the query class\&. The default \fIclass\fP is IN; other classes are HS for
Hesiod records or CH for Chaosnet records\&.
.RE
.PP
\-f \fIфайл\fP
.RS 4
Batch mode: \fBdig\fP reads a list of lookup requests to process from the given
\fIfile\fP\&. Each line in the file should be organized in the same way they
would be presented as queries to \fBdig\fP using the command\-line interface\&.
.RE
.PP

Do reverse IPv6 lookups using the obsolete RFC 1886 IP6\&.INT domain, which
is no longer in use\&. Obsolete bit string label queries (RFC 2874) are not
attempted\&.
.RE
.PP
\-k \fIфайл_ключа\fP
.RS 4
Sign queries using TSIG using a key read from the given file\&. Key files
can be generated using \fBtsig\-keygen\fP(8)\&. When using TSIG authentication
with \fBdig\fP, the name server that is queried needs to know the key and
algorithm that is being used\&. In BIND, this is done by providing
appropriate \fBkey\fP and \fBserver\fP statements in named\&.conf\&.
.RE
.PP
\-m
.RS 4

configured to listen for queries on a non\-standard port number\&.
.RE

.RS 4
Do not read options from ${HOME}/\&.digrc\&. This is useful for scripts that
need predictable behaviour\&.
.RE
.PP
\-t \fIтип\fP
.RS 4
The resource record type to query\&. It can be any valid query type\&. If it
is a resource record type supported in BIND 9, it can be given by the type
mnemonic (such as "NS" or "AAAA")\&. The default query type is "A", unless
the \fB\-x\fP option is supplied to indicate a reverse lookup\&. A zone transfer
can be requested by specifying a type of AXFR\&. When an incremental zone
transfer (IXFR) is required, set the \fItype\fP to ixfr=N\&. The incremental
zone transfer will contain the changes made to the zone since the serial
number in the zone\*(Aqs SOA record was \fIN\fP\&.
.sp
All resource record types can be expressed as "TYPEnn", where "nn" is the
number of the type\&. If the resource record type is not supported in BIND
9, the result will be displayed as described in RFC 3597\&.

.RE
.PP
\-x \fIадреса\fP
.RS 4
Simplified reverse lookups, for mapping addresses to names\&. The \fIaddr\fP is
an IPv4 address in dotted\-decimal notation, or a colon\-delimited IPv6
address\&. When the \fB\-x\fP is used, there is no need to provide the \fIname\fP,
\fIclass\fP and \fItype\fP arguments\&.  \fBdig\fP automatically performs a lookup
for a name like 94\&.2\&.0\&.192\&.in\-addr\&.arpa and sets the query type
and class to PTR and IN respectively\&. IPv6 addresses are looked up using
nibble format under the IP6\&.ARPA domain (but see also the \fB\-i\fP option)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-y \fI[hmac:]\fP\fIназва_ключа:пароль\fP
.RS 4
Sign queries using TSIG with the given authentication key\&.  \fIkeyname\fP is
the name of the key, and \fIsecret\fP is the base64 encoded shared secret\&.
\fIhmac\fP is the name of the key algorithm; valid choices are hmac\-md5,
hmac\-sha1, hmac\-sha224, hmac\-sha256, hmac\-sha384, or hmac\-sha512\&. If
\fIhmac\fP is not specified, the default is hmac\-md5 or if MD5 was disabled
hmac\-sha256\&.
.sp
NOTE: You should use the \fB\-k\fP option and avoid the \fB\-y\fP option, because
with \fB\-y\fP the shared secret is supplied as a command line argument in clear
text\&. This may be visible in the output from \fBps\fP(1)  or in a history
file maintained by the user\*(Aqs shell\&.
.RE
.SH "ПАРАМЕТРИ ЗАПИТУ"
.PP
\fBdig\fP provides a number of query options which affect the way in which
lookups are made and the results displayed\&. Some of these set or reset
flag bits in the query header, some determine which sections of the answer
get printed, and others determine the timeout and retry strategies\&.
.PP
Each query option is identified by a keyword preceded by a plus sign
(+)\&. Some keywords set or reset an option\&. These may be preceded by the
string no to negate the meaning of that keyword\&. Other keywords assign
values to options like the timeout interval\&. They have the form
\fB+keyword=value\fP\&. Keywords may be abbreviated, provided the abbreviation
is unambiguous; for example, +cd is equivalent to +cdflag\&. The query
options are:

The BIND 9 implementation of \fBdig \fP supports specifying multiple queries on
the command line (in addition to supporting the \fB\-f\fP batch file
option)\&. Each of those queries can be supplied with its own set of flags,
options and query options\&.
.PP
In this case, each \fIquery\fP argument represent an individual query in the
command\-line syntax described above\&. Each consists of any of the standard
options and flags, the name to be looked up, an optional query type and
class and any query options that should be applied to that query\&.
.PP
A global set of query options, which should be applied to all queries, can
also be supplied\&. These global query options must precede the first tuple
of name, class, type, options, flags, and query options supplied on the
command line\&. Any global query options (except the \fB+[no]cmd\fP option) can
be overridden by a query\-specific set of query options\&. For example:
.sp
dig +qr www\&.isc\&.org any \-x 127\&.0\&.0\&.1 isc\&.org ns +noqr
.sp
shows how \fBdig\fP could be used from the command line to make three lookups:
an ANY query for www\&.isc\&.org, a reverse lookup of 127\&.0\&.0\&.1 and a
query for the NS records of isc\&.org\&. A global query option of \fI+qr\fP is
applied, so that \fBdig\fP shows the initial query it made for each
lookup\&. The final query has a local query option of \fI+noqr\fP which means
that \fBdig\fP will not print the initial query when it looks up the NS records
for isc\&.org\&.
.SH "ПІДТРИМКА IDN"
.PP
If \fBdig\fP has been built with IDN (internationalized domain name) support,
it can accept and display non\-ASCII domain names\&.  \fBdig\fP appropriately
converts character encoding of domain name before sending a request to DNS
server or displaying a reply from the server\&. If you\*(Aqd like to turn
off the IDN support for some reason, use parameters \fI+noidnin\fP and
\fI+noidnout\fP or define the \fBIDN_DISABLE\fP environment variable\&.
