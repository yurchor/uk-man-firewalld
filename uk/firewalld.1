firewalld \- Dynamic Firewall Manager

.SH ОПИС
.PP
firewalld provides a dynamically managed firewall with support for
network/firewall zones to define the trust level of network connections or
interfaces\&. It has support for IPv4, IPv6 firewall settings and for
ethernet bridges and has a separation of runtime and permanent configuration
options\&. It also supports an interface for services or applications to add
firewall rules directly\&.
.SH ПАРАМЕТРИ
.PP
These are the command line options of firewalld:
.PP
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
.RS 4
Prints a short help text and exists\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-default\-config\fP
.RS 4
Path to firewalld default configuration\&. This usually defaults to
\fI/usr/lib/firewalld\fP\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-debug\fP[=\fIlevel\fP]
.RS 4
Set the debug level for firewalld to \fIlevel\fP\&. The range of the debug
level is 1 (lowest level) to 10 (highest level)\&. The debug output will be
written to the firewalld log file \fI/var/log/firewalld\fP\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-debug\-gc\fP
.RS 4
Print garbage collector leak information\&. The collector runs every 10
seconds and if there are leaks, it prints information about the leaks\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-nofork\fP
.RS 4
Turn off daemon forking\&. Force firewalld to run as a foreground process
instead of as a daemon in the background\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-nopid\fP
.RS 4
Disable writing pid file\&. By default the program will write a pid
file\&. If the program is invoked with this option it will not check for an
existing server process\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-system\-config\fP
.RS 4
Path to firewalld system (user) configuration\&. This usually defaults to
\fI/etc/firewalld\fP\&.
.RE
.SH CONCEPTS
.PP
firewalld has a D\-Bus interface for firewall configuration of services and
applications\&. It also has a command line client for the user\&. Services
or applications already using D\-Bus can request changes to the firewall with
the D\-Bus interface directly\&. For more information on the firewalld D\-Bus
interface, please have a look at \fBfirewalld.dbus\fP(5)\&.
.PP
firewalld provides support for zones, predefined services and ICMP types and
has a separation of runtime and permanent configuration options\&. Permanent
configuration is loaded from XML files in \fI/usr/lib/firewalld\fP
(\fB\-\-default\-config\fP) or \fI/etc/firewalld\fP (\fB\-\-system\-config\fP) (see the
section called \(lqDIRECTORIES\(rq)\&.
.PP
If NetworkManager is not in use and firewalld gets started after the network
is already up, the connections and manually created interfaces are not bound
to the zone specified in the ifcfg file\&. The interfaces will automatically
be handled by the default zone\&. firewalld will also not get notified about
network device renames\&. All this also applies to interfaces that are not
controlled by NetworkManager if \fINM_CONTROLLED=no\fP is set\&.
.PP
You can add these interfaces to a zone with \fBfirewall\-cmd [\-\-permanent]
\-\-zone=\fP\fIzone\fP\fB \-\-add\-interface=\fP\fIinterface\fP\&. If there is a
/etc/sysconfig/network\-scripts/ifcfg\-\fIinterface\fP file, firewalld tries to
change the ZONE=\fIzone\fP setting in this file\&.
.PP
If firewalld gets reloaded, it will restore the interface bindings that were
in place before reloading to keep interface bindings stable in the case of
NetworkManager uncontrolled interfaces\&. This mechanism is not possible in
the case of a firewalld service restart\&.
.PP
It is essential to keep the ZONE= setting in the ifcfg file consistent to
the binding in firewalld in the case of NetworkManager uncontrolled
interfaces\&.
.SS Зони
.PP
A network or firewall zone defines the trust level of the interface used for
a connection\&. There are several pre\-defined zones provided by
firewalld\&. Zone configuration options and generic information about zones
are described in \fBfirewalld.zone\fP(5)
.SS Services
.PP
A service can be a list of local ports, protocols and destinations and
additionally also a list of firewall helper modules automatically loaded if
a service is enabled\&. Service configuration options and generic
information about services are described in \fBfirewalld.service\fP(5)\&. The
use of predefined services makes it easier for the user to enable and
disable access to a service\&.
.SS "ICMP types"
.PP
The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is used to exchange information
and also error messages in the Internet Protocol (IP)\&. ICMP types can be
used in firewalld to limit the exchange of these messages\&. For more
information, please have a look at \fBfirewalld.icmptype\fP(5)\&.
.SS "Runtime configuration"
.PP
Runtime configuration is the actual active configuration and is not
permanent\&. After reload/restart of the service or a system reboot, runtime
settings will be gone if they haven\*(Aqt been also in permanent
configuration\&.
.SS "Permanent configuration"
.PP
The permanent configuration is stored in config files and will be loaded and
become new runtime configuration with every machine boot or service
reload/restart\&.
.SS "Direct interface"
\fBDEPRECATED\fP
.RS 4
.PP
The direct interface has been deprecated\&. It will be removed in a future
release\&. It is superseded by policies, see \fBfirewalld.policies\fP(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
The direct interface is mainly used by services or applications to add
specific firewall rules\&. It requires basic knowledge of ip(6)tables
concepts (tables, chains, commands, parameters, targets)\&.
.SH DIRECTORIES
.PP
firewalld supports two configuration directories:
.SS "Default/Fallback configuration in \fI/usr/lib/firewalld\fP\fR (\-\-default\-config)\fP"
.PP
This directory contains the default and fallback configuration provided by
firewalld for icmptypes, services and zones\&. The files provided with the
firewalld package should not get changed and the changes are gone with an
update of the firewalld package\&. Additional \fBicmptypes\fP, \fBservices\fP and
\fBzones\fP can be provided with packages or by creating files\&.
.SS "System configuration settings in \fI/etc/firewalld\fP\fR (\-\-system\-config)\fP"
.PP
The system or user configuration stored here is either created by the system
administrator or by customization with the configuration interface of
firewalld or by hand\&. The files will overload the default configuration
files\&.
.PP
To manually change settings of pre\-defined icmptypes, zones or services,
copy the file from the default configuration directory to the corresponding
directory in the system configuration directory and change it accordingly\&.
.PP
For more information on icmptypes, please have a look at the
\fBfirewalld.icmptype\fP(5)  man page, for services at \fBfirewalld.service\fP(5)
and for zones at \fBfirewalld.zone\fP(5)\&.
.SH СИГНАЛИ
.PP
Currently only SIGHUP is supported\&.
.SS SIGHUP
.PP
Reloads the complete firewall configuration\&. You can also use
\fBfirewall\-cmd \-\-reload\fP\&. All runtime configuration settings will be
restored\&. Permanent configuration will change according to options defined
in the configuration files\&.
